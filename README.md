What is OpenTune?
========

OpenTune is a simple, easy way to download music. Built on top of node-webkit and several APIs, OpenTune finds the best audio 
source for any track by any artist online, downloads it and saves a clean MP3 file to your computer, and inserts proper metadata 
(title, artist, album, cover art) into the file to top it all off.

Quick Start
========

To start using OpenTune on your computer, download the repository and simply run opentune.exe. If you want to actually 
install OpenTune on your computer as a program, download the Windows installer or self-extracting Mac installer at http://opentune.co.

Development
========

OpenTune was initially conceived and created across a two-day hackathon. Since then, we've been periodically putting more time 
into it to try to make it reliable and releaseable. However, because most of the program was indeed written in a rush, there's a 
lot to be optimised and cleaned up. 

We decided to make OpenTune open-source because there's only so much we can do. We love the idea and how well it works now, but 
with some help from other developers, we think OpenTune could become something so much more.

With that said, anyone is free to contribute to this project. Refer to the "Goals" section below for what we'd love to get 
some help on. Please report any bugs or request features by opening up a GitHub Issue.

Goals
========

- Full album downloads
- Package stable Mac version
- Package & release stable Linux version
- Native Android app to download tracks directly onto device
